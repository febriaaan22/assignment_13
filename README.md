# WEEK 13 


## INTRODUCTION

Hi, iâ€™m Ireng Febrian Sanjaya and this is my assignment for week 13. This week is almost the same like last week but the difference is that I had to put alot of new page and connect the frontend to backend using API Postman that already provided by our instructor Mr. Ari Putra. I use Formik, Yup, and Ant Design for this one, the thing that makes me struggle alot is how to connect to backend, I need to learn a multiple time so I could understand and re-reading alot of code. 


## TOOLS

- Ant Design: CSS framework
- Formik & Yup: Validation
- Typescript: Programming Language
- React JS

## PAGES
Every page on this website have different purpose and each consist of different element. Here's description for each pages:

1. Login Page
